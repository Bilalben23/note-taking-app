# How do you test components

- anatomy of a component test
- isolate a component & set up a test case
- simulate interactions with tools like testing library
- run assertions with tools like Jest

# stories are test cases for everything a component does.

# mock networks requests to build pages

- Interactions panel visualizes steps.
- step through the interactions
- debug tests in the browser

# Execute test with test runner

- powered by Jest and Playwright
- run tests in parallel via command line
- watch mode, filters, etc

# Code coverage reports

- displays what part of the code is
- executed (or covered) after the test run
