## üß† Architecture: Atomic Design + CDD

This project follows the Atomic Design methodology:

| Layer         | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Atoms**     | Reusable UI elements (e.g., Button, Input) |
| **Molecules** | Combined atoms (e.g., NoteForm)            |
| **Organisms** | Complex components (e.g., NotesList)       |
| **Templates** | Full pages (e.g., NotePage)                |

CDD was used to build and test components in isolation first using **Storybook**, then compose them step-by-step into the final application.
